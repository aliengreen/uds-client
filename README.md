# Units Device Service Cloud API Client


The Unit Device Service Protocol (UdS) is a transfer protocol top of the UDP for use with resource limited devices. Specifically, low-power micro-controllers with small amounts of Flash Memory and RAM. The protocol is designed for M2M/machine-to-machine applications such as smart home automation (IoT), where a small code footprint is required. It is lightweight, simple to use. The protocol runs over UDP, or may run over other network protocols.

The UdS is used in [Mostat Wi-Fi thermostat](https://aliengreen.ge/en/thermostat/) produced by [Alien Green LLC](https://aliengreen.ge)
